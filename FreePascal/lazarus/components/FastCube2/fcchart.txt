The description of the new version of the TfcxChart component.

1. Data source adjustment of the chart:

Grid dimensions or list of measures can be chosen as the series list of the diagram.
Grid dimensions or list of measures can be chosen as the categories list (X axis) of the diagram.

To set type of the source use next property:

property TypeChartData: TfcxTypeChartData;

  TfcxTypeChartData = (
    tcd_ByAxisAxis,     // Categories and Series from Dimensions. Use for one measure.
    tcd_ByAxisMeasures, // Categories from Dimensions and Series from measures
    tcd_ByMeasuresAxis  // Categories from measures and Series from Dimensions
    )

It is possible to specify detail depth (count of levels) when you are
using dimensions of Grid as the series list and/or categories list.

For the series list:
property SeriesFieldCount: integer;

For the categories list:
property CategoriesFieldCount: integer;

If depth = 0, only TOTAL value is used.

If dimensions of the Grid are used for the series list and/or categories list
it is necessary to specify axis of the Grid (columns or rows).

For series list:
property SeriesAxis: TfcxAxisRegion;

For categories list:
property CategoriesAxis: TfcxAxisRegion;

  TfcxAxisRegion =
  (
    ar_ColAxis,
    ar_RowAxis
  );

If dimensions of the Grid are used for the series list and the categories list
(fcd_ByAxisAxis) it is necessary to specify index of the measure.

property MeasureFiledIndex: integer;
For the first visible measure: MeasureFiledIndex = 0.

2. Additional features:

You can freeze (do not change Chart on Slice change) chart:
property Frozen: Boolean; (or use appropriate button on the toolbar).

You can set properties of the data source of the diagram by code or in dialog
(use appropriate button on the toolbar).

If properties of the data source of the diagram are not correct TfcxChart writes 
"Chart properties are not correct".

3. Restrictions: 

It is impossible to use dimensions of the Grid as the series list and as the 
categories list if SeriesAxis = CategoriesAxis.
Detail depth (count of levels) should not be greater than count of 
grid axis levels.
Detail depth (count of levels) should not include "Measures" dimension.
Index of the measure (MeasureFiledIndex) must be smaller than count of 
visible measures.

4. Print TfcxChart in FastReport.
You can print Chart from the application form.
Use component TfcxpChartProvider. Set properties:
    property Chart: TfcxChart;
    property Enabled: Boolean; // Enable for selection
    property UserName: String; // Name of the component

In FastReport4 designer set TfcxpChartView properties:
    property fcxpChartProvider: TfcxpChartProvider;
or
    property fcxpChartProviderName: String;
