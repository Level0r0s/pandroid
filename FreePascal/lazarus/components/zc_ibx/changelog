IBX Change Log  version          (1.0-4) Thu, 28 Feb 2013 16:56:13 +0000

1. In a TIBCustomDataset descendent, a generator now only sets the value when
   it is null. This allows for alternative user defined setting of the generator

   Many thanks to Julio JimÃ©nez for this fix

2. An Error Dialog is now displayed in the Lazarus IDE if IBX cannot find the Firebird Library
   and suggests that the user may have forgotten to install it.

1. Conditional compilation used to limit registration of TIntegerField to
   Lazarus versions less than 1.1

2. When a database connection is created, character set is now by default set
   to UTF8 (Unix) or to the current Windows code page (Windows) if in the range
   1250 to 1254.


IBX Change Log  version     (1.0-2) Tue, 09 Oct 2012 09:10:30 +0100

1. TBookmark change conditional compile changed to > 2.6.2 to match expected availability of change.


IBX Change Log  version    (1.0-1) Sun, 05 Aug 2012 20:00:04 +0100

1. In IBCustomDataset. Changed CurBookmark from string to TBookmark for compiler versions > 2.6.0
   Necessary because of TBookmark type and TDataSet.Bookmark property change in fpc 2.7.1

2. IBX now registers TIntegerField as a "No Icon" component. This may be removed if the fpc DB
   package is changed to do this (which it should do).

IBX Change Log  version (1.0-0)  Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:43:00 +0100

1. Add "if active then active := false" to TIBCustomDataset destructor. (Avoid error on database close).

2. Make use of $STATIC conditional in IBSQLMonitor (Needed for FPC 2.6.0 compliance)

3. Database Property Editor: Character Set drop down box now uses "OnChange" rather than "OnCloseUp" to react to changes

4. Property editors should now correctly resize.

5. In IBDatabaseEdit.TestClick, the LoginPrompt is now set to the state of the LoginPrompt Checkbox
   (restored original functionality)

6. Under OSX, if IBX fails to load libfbclient.dylib, it will now try and load the firebird
   library using the absolute path /Library/Frameworks/Firebird.framework/Firebird.
